# Timestamp Microservice

My solution for one of the tasks from [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/request-header-parser-microservice). This task involved creation of simple timestamp microservice according to the given guidelines that can be found in the above link. The solution is currently available on [my website](https://headerparser.profresor.net)

## Setup

Micro service can be run using the following command run from the project directory:
```
sudo docker compose up -d
```

As the result, the microservice will be available at 127.0.0.1:10001.

## Description
